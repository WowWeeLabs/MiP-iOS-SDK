It looks like Apple is currently rejecting apps which have a framework that includes simulator support. 

We have a special version of the framework which has stripped out simulator support for submitting to the AppStore.

It's exactly the same as the normal framework except it only includes mobile device support.

Please refer to issue #4 if you have any questions on this
